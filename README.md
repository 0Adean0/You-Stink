## Technologies Used

This application utilizes React to create an interactive front end experience. The site can toggle between home page, login, sign-up, and product pages without leaving the base HTML site. Products, brands, and shopping carts are saved in IndexedDB to allow for persistant data. MongoDB/Mongoose is used for the models and schema. The site also uses a manifest in order to give the site its own unique icon in the browser.
