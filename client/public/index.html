  <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      <h2>The History of Deoderant</h2>
      <p>When you think of deodorant you think of stink! However, our modern 18 billion dollar industry wasn’t always so prevalent. The quest to conquer stink began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and the greatest weapon used was consumer deprecating marketing, targeting the insecurities of women, their initial target audience. The initial product that would break the mold was Odorono who’s owner, Edna Murphy and travel salesman James Yong launched to international fame. By 1927 sales of Odorono reached $1 million dollars and competitors began to utilize the same advertising and marketing methods that made deodorant famous. By 1935 the first commercially specific deodorant for men, Top Flite, was released based on the ideology that a smelly man not only repulsed their fairer counterparts but could miss out on business opportunities as well. Today, deodorant and anti-perspirants is an 18 billion dollar industry spread to every country in the world.</p>
